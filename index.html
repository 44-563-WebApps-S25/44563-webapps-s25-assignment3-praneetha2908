<h2>Code Snippet</h2>
<pr>This basic Node.js code is used to grab specified command-line arguments, we use the process module which gives control over the current Node.js process, and we remove the first two arguments from the command-line, the Node.js executable and the executed file name.</pr>
<pre>
    <code>
        const getCmdArguments = () => process.argv.slice(2); 
    </code>
